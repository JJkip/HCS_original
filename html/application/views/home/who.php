    <h2>Health Consortium Somalia</h2>
        <p>
            The Health Consortium Somalia (HCS) is a consortium of five International NGOs working together to implement an integrated health program in targeted areas of Somaliland, Puntland and South Central. This 5 year program (2010-2015) is funded and supported by the UK Department for International Development (DFID).
        </p>
        <p>
            Somalia is a UK National Security Council priority country. The British Government through DFID fund HCS alongside other interventions in line with the DFID Operational Plan and the UK Strategy, to contribute to local peace building and stability. HCS will further enable transition from a humanitarian to a longer-term approach (where appropriate) and, through increased Somali capacity, will help build resilience through a stronger health response to future crises.
        </p>
        <p>
            Working in partnership with health authorities, civil society and communities the HCS aims to increase the range, quality, and use of health services and improve the health status of the Somali people with a focus on reproductive, maternal and child health. The programme supports the provision of an Essential Package of Health Services (EPHS), including antenatal and postnatal care, skilled birth attendance, vaccinations and emergency and basic nutrition services,as well as child spacing services and products. Therefore, the HCS plays a strategic role in strengthening the health system of the three zones and contributing to the improvement of health indicators.
        </p>
        <p>
            The influence of the HCS is, however, wider than just the geographical target areas; for instance, support in strengthening local governance and national policy, including human resources, is being shared across the Somalia health sector to improve overall health services.
